## About The Project

### Description
An analysis of sailing club data to determine membership conversion and course popularity

## Project Proposal

### Motivation
What problem are you tackling?
Our group aims to tackle finding optimal parts that lead to the most bookings made and see if we can find any relationships in the conversions from students becoming members. We will be looking at past data to try and be able to make informed decisions and modifications for the future for this company. This is worthwhile as it provides us with practical experience in finding points of improvement for a business in industry. Therefore, our findings, if presented, could be impactful in helping a small business improve based on the information they already have. This would allow them to provide a better experience for their customers as well as a greater understanding of what draws a customer to book in the first place.

### Dataset
What data will you use and how will you collect it?
One of our team members runs Dingle Sailing Club, which is a sailing and powerboat school company in Dingle, Co. Kerry. Through this we have been given access to a substantial aggregation of anonymised data, which has been collected from a diverse range of courses, users and weather conditions over the past number of years. Being able to ask the company about what insights would be useful alongside being able to use a verifiably accurate dataset means our project will give us great exposure into the real world applications of machine learning.

### Methods & Intended Experiments

What machine learning techniques are you planning to apply or improve upon? What experiments are you planning to run?
Since we are looking to predict the number of memberships for a particular course based on our data, we need to use some sort of linear regression model. In addition to this, we will need to do some feature engineering of the data to create the best fit for the linear regression model. While we are creating our linear model, we will need to cross-validate our hyperparameters.

We also want to find any relationships in the conversions from students becoming members, in order to do this we are planning on doing multiple logistic regressions to find the features that give us the best F1-score performance metric. From this we can then determine which features best predict the conversion from students to becoming members.
